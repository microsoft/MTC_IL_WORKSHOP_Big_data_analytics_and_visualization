# Big data analytics and visualization whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this whiteboard design session, you will work with a group to design a solution for ingesting and preparing historic flight delay and weather data and creating, training, and deploying a machine learning model that can predict flight delays.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will have learned how to include a web application that obtains weather forecasts from a 3rd party, collects flight information from end-users, and sends that information to the deployed machine learning model for scoring. Part of the exercise will include providing visualizations of historic flight delays and orchestrating the collection and batch scoring of historic and new flight delay data.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1. Meet your team members and trainer.

2. Read all directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3. As a team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Margie's Travel (MT) provides concierge services for business travelers. In an increasingly crowded market, they are always looking for ways to differentiate themselves and provide added value to their corporate customers.

MT is investigating ways to capitalize on their existing data assets to provide new insights that provide them a strategic advantage against their competition. In planning their product, they heard much fanfare about machine learning and came up with the idea of using predictive analytics to help customers best select their travels based on the likelihood of a delay. When reviewing their customer transaction histories, they discovered that their most premium customers often book their travel within seven days of departure. In speaking with customer service, they learned that these customers often ask questions like, "I don't have to be there until Tuesday, so is it better for me to fly out on Sunday or Monday?"

While there are many factors that customer service uses to tailor their guidance to the customer (such as cost and travel duration), MT believes an innovative solution might come in the form of giving the customer an assessment of the risk of encountering flight delays. The customer may choose to book with a narrower travel window for low-risk flights, giving them more precious time at home and less on the road spent arriving too early to a destination. MT is interested in applying data science to the problem to discover if the weather forecast and their historical flight delay data could provide meaningful input into the customer's decision-making process.

MT plans to pilot this solution internally, whereby the small population of customer support who service MT's premium tier of business travelers would begin using the solution and offering it as an additional data point for travel optimization. They would like to provide their customer support agents a web-based solution that enables them to map the predicted delays for a particular customer's departure airport(s) of choice.

MT has over 30 years of historical flight data provided to them by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), which among other data points, includes flight delay information for every flight. The data arrives in flat, comma-separated value (CSV) files with a schema of the following:

(Year, Month, DayOfMonth, Airline, TailNum, FlightNum, OriginAirport, DestinationAirport, ScheduledDepartureTime, ActualDepartureTime, ScheduledArrivalTime, DepartureDelay, AirTime, Distance, Cancelled, CancellationCode)

In addition, for all data since 2003, each row includes new fields describing the type of delay experienced, where the value for each type is the number of minutes the delay was experienced for that source of delay:

(CarrierDelay, WeatherDelay, NationalAirSystemDelay, SecurityDelay, LateAircraftDelay)

They receive updates to this data monthly, where the flight data and other related files total about 1 GB. In total, their solution currently manages about 2 TB worth of data.

Additionally, they receive current and forecasted weather data from a third-party service. This service gives them the ability to receive weather forecasts around any airport and provides forecasts for up to 10 days. They have a history of each flight's historical weather condition as CSV files but acquiring the weather forecasts requires a call to a REST API that returns a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) structure. Each airport of interest needs to be queried individually. An excerpt of the weather forecast for a single day at the Seattle-Tacoma International airport is as follows:

```json
{
  "date": {
    "epoch": "1444701600",
    "pretty": "7:00 PM PDT on October 12, 2015",

  "minhumidity": 0
}
```

Jack Tradewinds, the CIO of MT, is looking to modernize their data story. He has heard a great deal of positive news about Spark SQL on Azure Databricks and its ability to query exactly the type of files he has in a performant way, but also in a way that is more familiar to his analysts and developers because they are all familiar with the SQL syntax that it supports. He would love to understand if they can move this data away from their on-premises data center into the cloud and enhance their ability to load, process, and analyze it going forward. Given his long-standing relationship with Microsoft, he would like to see if Azure can meet his needs.

### Customer needs

1. Want to modernize their analytics platform without sacrificing the ability to query their data using SQL.

2. Need an approach that can store all their data, including the unmodified source data and the cleansed data they query for production purposes.

3. Want to understand how they will load their large quantity of historical data into Azure.

4. Need to be able to query the weather forecast and use it as input to their flight delay predictions.

5. Desire a proof of concept (PoC) machine learning model that takes as input their historical data on flight delays and weather conditions to identify whether a flight is likely to be delayed or not.

6. Need web-based visualizations of the flight delay predictions.

### Customer objections

1. We have heard that creating a machine learning model takes a month to build and another 2-3 months to operationalize so that it is useable from our production systems. Is this true?

2. Once our model is operationalized, how do we retrain and redeploy it? Will this process break clients currently accessing the deployed model?

3. Can we query flat files in the file system using SQL?

4. Does Azure provide anything that would speed up querying (and exploration) files in Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS)?

5. Does Azure provide any tools for visualizing our data? Ideally, access to these could be managed with Active Directory.

6. Can we use Azure Active Directory accounts for our users? If so, can we restrict who can access Azure Databricks when they can access it, require two-factor authentication, and restrict access if there is suspicious activity on their account?

7. Is Azure Databricks our only option for running SQL on Hadoop solutions in Azure?

8. We have heard of Azure Data Lake, but we are not clear about whether this is currently a good fit for our PoC solution or whether we should be using it for interactive analysis of our data.

9. We are hiring a data scientist who prefers to use MLflow to track model training run metrics and artifacts. Can the proposed Azure-based solution support this library?

### Infographic for common scenarios

![The Data Analytics diagram is broken into three sections: On-Premises, Azure, and End Users. On-Premises includes a Web Server with log files and an end-user with a computer and a portable device. The Azure section contains three parts: Generation (Azure website and log files), Storage (Azure SQL Database and Blob Storage), and Data Processing (SQL Data Warehouse, Machine Learning, and HDInsight (Hadoop). The End Users section has Business Intelligence and End Users with portable devices.](media/common-scenarios.png 'Data Analytics diagram')

## Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 60 minutes

**Business needs**

Directions: With your team, answer the following questions and be prepared to present your solution to others:

1. Who will you present this solution to? Who is your target customer audience? Who are the decision makers?

2. What customer business needs do you need to address with your solution?

**Design**

Directions: With your team, respond to the following questions:

_High-level architecture_

1. Without getting into the details (the following sections will address the details), diagram your initial vision for handling the top-level requirements for data loading, data preparation, storage, machine learning modeling, and reporting. You will refine this diagram as you proceed.

_Data loading_

1. How would you recommend that MT get their historical data into Azure? What services would you suggest and what are the specific steps they would need to take to prepare the data, to transfer the data, and where would the loaded data land?

2. Update your diagram with the data loading process with the steps you identified.

_Data preparation_

1. What service would you recommend MT capitalize on to explore the flat files they get from the USDOT using SQL?

2. What specific configuration would you use? What components of Azure Databricks would you use to allow MT analysts to query and prep the data? How would they author and execute these data prep tasks?

3. How would you suggest MT integrate weather forecast data?

_Machine learning modeling_

1. What technology would you recommend that MT use for implementing their machine learning model?

2. How would you guide MT to load data so that the machine learning model can process it?

3. What category of machine learning algorithm would you recommend to MT to construct their model? For this scenario, your option is clustering, regression, or two-class classification. Why?

4. Assuming you selected an algorithm that requires training, address the following model design questions:

   a. What is the high-level flow of your machine learning model?

   b. What attributes of the flight and weather data do you think MT should use in predicting flight delays? How would you recommend that MT identify the columns that provide the most predictive value in determining if a flight will be delayed? Be specific on the particular modules or libraries they could use and how they would apply them against the data.

   c. Some of the data may need a little touching up: columns need to be removed; data types need to be changed. How would these steps be applied in your model?

   d. How would you recommend MT measure the success of their model?

_Operationalizing machine learning_

1. How can MT release their model for production use and avoid their concerns about extremely long delays operationalizing the model? Be specific on how your model is packaged, hosted, and invoked.

2. MT has shown interest in not only scoring a flight at a time (based on a customer's request), but also doing scoring in large chunks so that they could show summaries of predicted flight delays across the United States. What changes would you need to make to your ML model to support this?

3. MT wants a cost-effective data store to serve the results from the batch scoring process. The reporting and visualization service should use this data store as opposed to connecting to costly compute clusters. Which data store do you propose, and how will the compute environment that performs batch scoring securely connect to this serving layer without exposing connection strings or other secrets?

_Visualization and reporting_

1. Is Power BI an option for MT to use in visualizing the flight delays?

2. If so, explain:

   a. How would MT load the data and plot it on a map? What specific components would you use, and how would you configure them to display the data?

   b. If they need to make minor changes, such as a change to the data types of a column in the model, how would they perform this in Power BI?

   c. How could they secure access to these reports to only their internal customer service agents?

3. MT wants a way to monitor their data pipeline, including ETL, data preparation, and model training activities. How can they capture and visualize metrics to watch for problems such as performance bottlenecks? How can they quickly access the logs from a single location?

**Prepare**

Directions: As a team:

1. Identify any customer needs that are not addressed with the proposed solution.

2. Identify the benefits of your solution.

3. Determine how you will respond to the customer's objections.

Prepare a 15-minute chalk-talk style presentation to the customer.

## Step 3: Present the solution

**Outcome**

Present a solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 30 minutes

**Presentation**

Directions:

1. Pair with another team.

2. One group is the Microsoft team, the other is the customer.

3. The Microsoft team presents their proposed solution to the customer.

4. The customer makes one of the objections from the list of objections.

5. The Microsoft team responds to the objection.

6. The customer team gives feedback to the Microsoft team.

7. Switch roles and repeat Steps 2-6.

## Wrap-up

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: Reconvene with the larger group to hear the facilitator/SME share the preferred solution for the case study.
