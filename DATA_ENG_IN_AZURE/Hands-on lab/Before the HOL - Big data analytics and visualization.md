# Big data analytics and visualization before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

   - Trial subscriptions will not work.

2. If you are not a Service Administrator or Co-administrator for the Azure subscription, or if you are running the lab in a hosted environment, you will need to install [Visual Studio 2022 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with the **ASP.NET and web development** and **Azure development** workloads.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all the steps provided in the Before the Hands-on Lab section to prepare your environment _before_ attending the hands-on lab.

### Task 1: Create an Azure resource group using the Azure Portal

In this task, you will use the Azure Portal to create a new Azure Resource Group for this lab.

1. Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. On the top-left corner of the portal, select the menu icon to display the menu.

    ![The portal menu icon is displayed.](media/portal-menu-icon.png "Menu icon")

3. In the left-hand menu, select **Resource Groups**.

4. At the top of the screen select the **+ New** option to add a new resource group.

   ![The Add Resource Group Menu is displayed.](media/add-resource-group-menu.png 'Resource Group Menu')

5. Create a new resource group with the name **hands-on-lab-bigdata**, ensuring that the proper subscription and region nearest you are selected.  Once you have chosen a location, select **Review + Create**.

6. On the Summary blade, select **Create** to provision your resource group.

### Task 2: Deploy Azure resources

The below ARM template deploys several Azure resources for the labs, including Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, storage accounts, Event Hubs, Stream Analytics, Key Vault, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Machine Learning, etc.

1. Deploy the workspace through the following Azure ARM template (select the button below):

    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft%2FMCW-Big-data-and-visualization%2Fmain%2FHands-on%20lab%2Fsetup%2F%2Farm.json" target="_blank"><img src="https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton" /></a>

2. On the **Custom deployment** form fill in the fields described below.

   - **Subscription**: Select your desired subscription for the deployment.
   - **Resource group**: Select the resource group you previously created.
   - **Region**: The region where your Azure resources will be created.

   - **Unique Suffix**: This unique suffix will be used naming resources that will be created as part of your deployment, such as your initials followed by the current date in YYYYMMDD format (ex. `klf20211031`). Make sure you follow correct Azure [Resource naming](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging#resource-naming) conventions.

   ![The form is configured as described.](media/arm-template.png "Deploy Azure resources")

3. Select the **Review + create** button, then **Create**. The provisioning of your deployment resources will take approximately 5 minutes.


### Task 3: Configure Databricks Access To Azure Data Lake Storage

TODO 


### Task 4: Download and install Power BI Desktop

Power BI desktop is required to connect to your Azure Databricks environment when creating the Power BI dashboard.

1. Download and install [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

Note: You should follow all these steps provided _before_ attending the Hands-on lab.
